# Evolution of Mobile Communication

In the early days of mobile communication, users were confined to a single carrier at a time. This meant that if you wanted to talk to someone who was on a different carrier, you would have to switch to their carrier. This was not only inconvenient but also limited the options available to users.

Similarly, in the blockchain space, users have been confined to a single blockchain at a time. This limits the functionality and use cases of the blockchain ecosystem. Wormhole aims to change this by creating a cross-chain ecosystem that enables different blockchains to communicate and interact with each other seamlessly.

Wormhole acts as a crypto bridge that connects different blockchains, allowing the transfer of assets from one blockchain to another. This creates a more inclusive and robust blockchain ecosystem where users are not limited to a single blockchain and can explore different networks based on their specific needs and requirements."
