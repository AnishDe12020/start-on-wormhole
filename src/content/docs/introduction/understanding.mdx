# What is Wormhole?

In 2020, Certus One introduced Wormhole V1 as a token bridge connecting Ethereum and Solana. This pioneering version played a crucial role in establishing liquidity within the early Solana and Serum ecosystems. However, Wormhole's purpose transcended simple token transfers.

The launch of Wormhole V2 in August 2021 marked a significant milestone in the world of blockchain interoperability. It transformed Wormhole into a decentralized protocol for multiple blockchain ecosystems, supporting Solana, Terra, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. Since then, Wormhole has continuously evolved, expanding its compatibility with an ever-growing list of blockchains and smart contract runtimes.

While its primary function remains as a generic interoperability protocol, Wormhole has evolved into an ecosystem and platform tailored to developers. It offers modular components that can be easily integrated, allowing diverse teams to create innovative applications. This adaptability makes Wormhole a driving force behind the growth and innovation in the realm of decentralized computing.
