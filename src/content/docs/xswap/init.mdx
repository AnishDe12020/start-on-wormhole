## Installing Ganache

Ganache is your go-to tool for launching a personal EVM-powered blockchain on your local system. It's designed for testing purposes to simulate the Ethereum network environment. Let's get Ganache up and running:

1. Visit the [Official Ganache Website](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) and get the installer file.
2. Simply run the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard to complete the installation process.
3. Just spin up a new Ethereum workspace on your local system using the Quickstart option. This will be used to deploy and test the contracts.

4. Ganache will provide you with a set of testing wallets and private keys, running locally on [http://127.0.0.1:7545](http://127.0.0.1:7545/).

Now that your development environment is all set, let's dive into writing smart contracts and making it go cross-chain.

Now, get the Private Key of any of the accounts from Ganache and save it as a PATH variable. This will help make our lives easier while deploying the contract.

Into the terminal of the x-mail directory, type

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY='Your Private Key'
```

Now, you can access your private key from the terminal using the echo command. Just type in
```sh
echo $PRIVATE_KEY
```

and it will display the same key we had copied.
