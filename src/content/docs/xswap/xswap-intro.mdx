In this tutorial, we're going to dive into building a cool application that lets people borrow and lend assets across different blockchains. Imagine being able to borrow from one blockchain and lend on another, all in one place. Sounds amazing, right?

To make this happen, we'll be using the Wormhole Solidity SDK. Think of Wormhole as a toolkit that makes it easier for us to connect different blockchains. It's like building bridges between islands, allowing people to travel easily between them.

Now, the way we're going to set up our application is through the "hub-and-spoke" model. Picture a bicycle wheel. The center of the wheel is our "hub," and the spokes connect the hub to the outer circle. In our case, the hub is where all our main actions happen, and the spokes are the different blockchains we connect to. This model makes our application efficient and easy to use.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good grasp of how to use the Wormhole SDK and how the hub-and-spoke model works in a real-world application. Whether you're new to blockchain or have some experience, this guide is designed to be easy to follow.

So, are you ready to jump in? Let's get started and build something awesome together!
