In this section, we will learn how to create a token bridge using Wormhole Connect. We will start by creating a React web application from scratch and then integrate Wormhole Connect to enable cross-chain transactions. Let's dive in!

## Creating a React App

To begin, we will create a React web app using the Create React App command with TypeScript template support. Open your terminal and run 

```bash
npx create-react-app bridge --template typescript
```

This command will generate a basic React web app called **Bridge** with TypeScript configuration.

You will get this as an output:

## Running the React App

Now that you have successfully created a React App, head over to any editor of your choice (I'll use VS Code) and start the app on your local development server.

Firstly, `cd` into the directory where you have created your react app by:

```bash
cd bridge
```

and then open the directory in VS Code and start the Local Development Server by running

```bash
code . && npm run start
```

This will open the directory in a VS Code window and spin up the react app on the local development server.
Now, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the app running.
