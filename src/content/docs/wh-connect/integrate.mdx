Now, we have a basic React App started, the only thing now left is to integrate the magic of Wormhole Connect SDK to get started with bridging tokens. 


## Initialising Wormhole Connect SDK

Let's get started by initialising the Wormhole Connect SDK in our **Bridge** app directory.

Now, in your app directory, install the Wormhole Connect SDK by running 

```bash
npm iÂ @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect
```

## Creating the Bridge

To create a very basic token bridge, head over to `src/App.tsx` and remove everything.

### Importing the SDK

First, let's import the Wormhole Connect SDK into our React App. For that, just add this line at the top:

```tsx
import WormholeBridge from "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect";
```


### Creating the App Function

After we have imported the SDK, we need to create a function that returns the imported bridge element. For that, add 

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeBridge />
  );
}
```

just below the imports.

### Final Steps: Exporting the Function

To get the contents of the `App` function on our webpage, we need to export it. Let's do that at the end of the code as well:

```tsx
export default App;
```

If you have been following through, your code may look like this:

```tsx
import WormholeBridge from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeBridge />
  );
}

export default App;
```

Save the file and your http://localhost:3000/ will show an output like this:

Wuhoooo!! You have created your own token bridge using the power of Wormhole.Now feel free to go here and there and bridge some tokens and get some wrapped assets over your favourite network.
