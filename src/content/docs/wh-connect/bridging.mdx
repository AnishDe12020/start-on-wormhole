Now that we have created our own bridge, it's time to play around and bridge some tokens from one chain to other.

## Bridging in Action

To bridge assets between chains, you need to connect both the wallets. Let's take an example of bridging MATIC from Polygon Mumbai to Solana Devnet.

### Getting some faucet

To play around with bridges, we need to get some fake coins (aka faucet). To get faucet for Polygon Mumbai network, head over to https://faucet.polygon.technology/
and paste your wallet address. You will get around 0.2 MATIC and that's enough for our exercise.

## Choosing assets

Now, head over to our bridge and connect your Metamask or any EVM Wallet and select MATIC as the asset to be bridged.

Going further, select Solana in the network and connect your Phantom or any other Solana wallet.

You may receive a message that no token account exists for wrapped MATIC on Solana. So, we will need to create a token account for that and it will encounter a minimal gas fees. 

After that, select the amount of MATIC you want to convert. I will go with 1 USD to get 1 USD in form of wrapped MATIC (WMATIC) on Solana.

Now, approve the transaction and depending on the network speed, it will wait for confirmations from source network, wormhole network and the destination network as well.
After getting the confirmations, you will be able to claim the tokens on your destination network.

The claiming process will require you to sign multiple transactions and after that, you will be able to see wrapped MATIC in your wallet:

Now, let's see how you can customise your bridge ranging from colors to tokens and networks.
