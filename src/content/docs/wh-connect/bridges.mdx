Wormhole, the cross-chain interoperability protocol as recognised today, started as a traditional token bridge between Ethereum and Solana for its v1.
It was in August 2021, that Wormhole v2 was launched as the complete protocol.

Now that we know how the tokens are bridged from one chain to other, let's now get our hands dirty by creating out own token bridge using [Wormhole Connect](https://wormhole.com/connect/).
