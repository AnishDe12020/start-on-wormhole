Wormhole Connect also offers a lot of customisation options out of the box! You can control which networks to bridge to or from which networks the bridge can accept tokens. 

Here's an example of a bridge only on Ethereum, Solana and Polygon that accepts only ETH, wETH, MATIC and wMATIC:

```tsx
import WormholeBridge, { WormholeConnectConfig } from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

const config: WormholeConnectConfig = {
  env: "mainnet",
  networks: ["ethereum", "polygon", "solana"],
  tokens: ["ETH", "WETH", "MATIC", "WMATIC"],
  rpc: {
    ethereum: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth",
    solana: "https://rpc.ankr.com/solana",
  }
}

function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeBridge config={config} />
  );
}

export default App;
```


Now, this will give the output as

Similarly, you can change the config to change the supported networks as per your requirements.

That's it for now, from the next section, we will dive into some solidity code and will bridge messages over different chains.
