Let's get into Behind the scenes of how the greeting gets transferred from the source chain to the target chain:

1. **Instruction and Payment Delivery:** A user invokes HelloWormhole's `sendCrossChainGreeting` function which triggers Wormhole Relayer contract's `sendPayloadToEvm` function. This publishes the delivery instructions to the blockchain logs and pays the default delivery provider.
    
2. **Signature Collection:** Guardians, who monitor wormhole-connected blockchains, sign the delivery instructions, creating a Verifiable Action Approval (VAA). Once 13 out of 19 guardians sign the VAA, it's considered fully signed.
    
3. **Instruction Parsing:** The Delivery Provider watches for its assigned VAAs, parses the delivery instructions off-chain, and calls the `deliver` endpoint on the Wormhole Relayer contract on the target chain.
    
4. **VAA Verification and Payload Transfer:** The Wormhole Relayer contract verifies the signatures of the delivery VAA, parses the delivery instructions, and calls the `receiveWormholeMessages` endpoint of the target address with the payload.
    
5. **Message Processing:** The HelloWormhole contract on the target chain then processes the received message, completing the cross-chain greeting transfer.
