You want to deploy a cross-chain contract? But just think if you have to write the contract, then deploy it on the source chain and then take the Contract ID and the go again to the source code, change it with the source chain ID and go through the hotchpotch of deploying it to another chain.

Oops! You realise that you missed something in the code. Now you'll eventually have to go through all that process again. Ahhh! I would have left Smart Contract development till now. But I haven't. Why? Wormhole's **Automatic Relayer** is the answer.

Sounds interesting? Let's take a deep dive into the concepts and the code, and then get our hands dirty by creating a cross-chain mailbox.
