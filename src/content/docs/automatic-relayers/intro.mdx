Looking to deploy a cross-chain contract? Picture this: you write the contract, deploy it on the source chain, grab the Contract ID, then tweak the source code with the source chain ID, and again go through the hectic task of deploying it on another chain.

Exciting, isn't it? Let's learn more about these concepts, dive into the code, and even build our own cross-chain mailbox.
